    <p>Hi everyone, welcome to the sixth blog of my GSoC'25 journey. I started the week by working on Stdlib Hashmaps and was able to <b>wrap up Hashmaps package</b> by Sunday evening. Now, <b>all test files</b> of Hashmaps are correctly executing without any errors, obviously, with workarounds. Also, <b>most examples</b> of hashmaps are working well. 
        Only a <b>few examples are not working</b> where creating workarounds is not possible. Some <b>non-working examples require Submodule Implementation</b> and thus, we can handle them after my work on Submodules. </p>

      <p>Firstly, I worked on examples of Hashmaps. Most of them were working well after creating <b>small-small workarounds</b>. Commit Link representing <b>workarounds related examples</b> of Hashmaps is <a href="https://github.com/czgdp1807/stdlib/commit/b3c768b88f350bece8f82c3a29ca3853c75d4449">workarounds for Hashmap examples</a>.
         After this, Working examples of Hashmaps were <b>set up on CI</b> to prevent regression. Link to <b>Merged Pull Request</b> for setting working examples on CI can be found <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/7834">here</a>.
         Some examples were not wokring and were diffcult to workaround. Commit link to track such examples is <a href="https://github.com/czgdp1807/stdlib/commit/710a6510eb1e16b6fc690fc9ce4b17fea29911d1">disabled examples</a>. </p>

      <p>After that, I started to work on <b>Test Maps file</b>. It was just a <b>repetition</b> of first two test files <b>(Test Open Maps and Test Chaining Maps)</b> which were compiled earlier and so, I didn't face much difficulties while compiling this test file. For the Compilation of Test Maps, only <b>one new MRE</b> was created which is <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/7852">Issue #7852</a>. Corresponding 
         <b>workaround</b> for this MRE is <a href="https://github.com/czgdp1807/stdlib/commit/ab9c3f65638d33f346c85ceacd66a003a4986594">workaround for issue #7852.</a> <b>Workarounds created in favour of Test Maps</b> can be tracked through <a href="https://github.com/czgdp1807/stdlib/commits/n-lf-hashmaps-5">n-lf-hashmaps-5</a>. With these workarounds, Test Map was also executing correctly without any errors or failures. Link
         to <b>Merged Pull Request</b> to set Test Maps on CI is <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/7853">here</a>.</p>

      <p>With these, we wrapped up Hashmaps package of Stdlib. After this, we moved to next phase of our GSoC journey which is <b>Submodules</b>. For the next two days, I investigated all <b>workarounds of stdlib that were related to submodules</b> to find various MREs related to it. From my research, I found that all submodule workarounds of stdlib were directly or indirectly related following two issues :- 
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/7270">Issue #7270</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/7871">Issue #7871</a></li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>Main reason behind both the issues was that the module interface was <b>not able to link</b> with its corresponding submodule implementation. Meanwhile, while creating MREs for submodule, I created a MRE related to <b>stdlib sorting</b> which is <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/7883">Issue #7883</a>. 
         I thought the workaround was related to submodule but eventually, found the MRE created from workaround was because of some other error. Also, I <b>fixed this MRE</b> in this <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/7900">Merged Pull Request</a>. Then, I read a bit about submodules and was able to 
         deduce following <b>features about submodules</b> :- 

         <ul>
          <li>Parent module can <b>compile without submodule</b> but using its subroutine or function in interface will cause the error.</li>
          <li>Submodule should always <b>compile after the compilation of parent module</b> as submodule uses modfile (.mod) of parent module for compilation.</li>
          <li>Submodule <b>provides implementation to interface</b> subroutines/functions of parent module.</li>
          <li>Interfaces are <b>not needed in submodules</b> — only implementations are written there</li>
          <li>Submodules can <b>access all the entities</b> (public/private) of Parent Module.</li>
          <li>Functions/subroutines present in Submodule can only be used if its <b>present in Module interface</b>.</li>
         </ul>
      </p>

      <p>Then, I studied a bit about how currently we are implementing submodules and modules in LFortran and with thorough discussion with <a href="https://github.com/certik">Ondrej Certik</a>, we came to following <b>plan</b> for submodule implementation :- 
         <ul>
          <li>1. Use <b>current machinery</b>, add <b>parent module and is_submodule flags</b> to the Module symbol</li>
          <li>2. <b>Import everything</b> from the parent module in a given submodule</li>
          <li>3. <b>Populate Function or Subroutine</b> of Parent Module with <b>implementation</b> when encountered in Submodule</li>
         </ul>
      </p>

      <p>For the next week, I am planning to work on the above discussed plan. I will use <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/7270">Issue #7270</a> as a <b>reference</b> to see if the things are going in the correct direction or not. By the end of next week, I will try to complete at <b>least first two steps</b> of 
         above discussed plan and will try my best to make as much progress as I can in the third step and eventually in <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/7270">Issue #7270</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Overall, I worked for <b>32 hours</b> this week and enjoyed the work that I did in the sixth week and would like to thank <a href="https://github.com/certik">Ondrej Certik</a>, <a href="https://github.com/HarshitaKalani">Harshita Kalani</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Pranavchiku">Pranav Goswami</a> and all the other 
      LFortran members for their reviews and suggestions which helped me a lot to tackle new difficulties. I am looking forward to continue my journey in the next week
      with the same excitement and enthusiasm and plan to complete my proposed tasks as quickly as I can.</p>
